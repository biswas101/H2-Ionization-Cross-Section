# H2-Ionization-Cross-Section
These scripts can find ionization cross section and sigma.dE
The theory behind this is mention in, "Theory and Design of Charged Particle Beams" Book by Martin Reiser
Using Cross_section_reiser.py we can find the Pictorial form of Hydrogen Ionization Cross Section
                  This wil create ionization_H2.txt
                  Make sure column name is U and s
Using cross_section_area.py we can find, Int(sigma.dE)
                  More info can be found on, https://journals.aps.org/prab/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.10.083501
